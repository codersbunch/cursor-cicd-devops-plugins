description: CI/CD pipeline standards for safe and reliable deployments
alwaysApply: true

pipeline-standards:

- All pipelines must run tests before deploying to any environment
- Never deploy directly to production without passing staging first
- Use environment-specific secrets stored in CI secret manager, never in code
- Tag every production deployment with a semantic version and git SHA
- Implement automated rollback on health check failure post-deployment
- Run security scans (SAST, dependency audit) in every pipeline
- Cache dependencies to reduce build times
- Use matrix builds to test across multiple runtime versions
- Keep pipeline configs DRY using reusable workflows or orbs
