cloud-resource-standards:

- Resource names: {project}-{environment}-{resource-type} (e.g., myapp-prod-rds)
- All resources must have tags: Environment, Project, Owner, CostCenter, ManagedBy=terraform
- Never use default VPC or default security groups in production
- All S3 buckets must have versioning enabled and public access blocked
- IAM roles follow least-privilege - no wildcard (*) actions in production policies
- All databases must be in private subnets with no public endpoint
- Enable CloudTrail/Audit Logs on all accounts
- Use remote state backend (S3+DynamoDB or Terraform Cloud) - never local state in production
- Pin all provider versions and module versions explicitly
